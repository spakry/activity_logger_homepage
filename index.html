        <p>Ever end your day wondering "What did I actually accomplish?" Our activity logger solves this by automatically capturing every meaningful action you take throughout the day. No more forgotten tasks or lost productivity insights — get instant summaries of your work patterns and optimize your workflow with data-driven insights from your logged actions.</p>

        <h2>Why an always‑on daemon?</h2>
        <p>Manual activity &amp; task tracking fails because you forget to log activities, and by day's end, you can't remember what you actually accomplished. Our daemon eliminates this problem by silently capturing your high‑level actions in the background. Every meaningful task gets logged automatically, creating a complete record of your day that you can summarize, review, and use to optimize your workflow patterns.</p>
