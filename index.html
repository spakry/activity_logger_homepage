        <p>Our logger runs as a lightweight daemon on your machine, silently recording your logical actions — not just every keystroke, but the meaningful tasks you complete. An AI assistant then analyzes those logs so you (or the AI) can review what you did and find ways to optimize your workflow.</p>

        <h2>Why an always‑on daemon?</h2>
        <p>Manual time tracking and note‑taking are error‑prone and time consuming. Our daemon works quietly in the background, capturing your high‑level actions without interrupting your flow. This automated record lets you or an AI assistant review a rich narrative of your day, recall what you did with full context and spot patterns to improve how you work.</p>

        <h2>What you get</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Automatic activity capture</strong> – records your keystrokes, clicks and applications without interrupting your flow.</li>
          <li><strong>AI‑powered analysis</strong> – groups your actions by tasks and projects to surface where your time goes and highlight inefficiencies.</li>
          <li><strong>Instant recall</strong> – search your personal activity timeline to find exactly what you worked on and when.</li>
          <li><strong>Privacy first</strong> – your data is stored locally and only you can decide what to share.</li>
